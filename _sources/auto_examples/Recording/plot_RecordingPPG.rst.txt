Recording PPG signal
====================

The py:class:`systole.recording.Oximeter` class can be used to read incoming PPG signal 
from `Nonin 3012LP Xpod USB pulse oximeter
<https://www.nonin.com/products/xpod/>`_ together with the `Nonin 8000SM 'soft-clip' 
fingertip sensors <https://www.nonin.com/products/8000s/>`_. This function can easily 
be integrated with other stimulus presentation software like `PsychoPy
<https://www.psychopy.org/>`_ to record cardiac activity during psychological 
experiments, or to synchronize stimulus delivery around cardiac phases (e.g. systole or
diastole).

Recording PPG singal

Recording and plotting your first PPG time-series only require a few lines of code:
First, open a serial port. Note that here we are using Systole's PPG simulation 
function so the example can run without any device plugged on the computer for the
demonstration. If you want to connect to an actual Nonin pulse oximeter, you simply
have to provide the port reference it is plugged in (see commented lines below). 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-39

.. code-block:: default


    ser = serialSim()  # Simulate a device

    # Use a USB device
    #import serial
    #ser = serial.Serial("COM4")  # Use this line for USB recording

Once the reference of the port created, you can create a recording instance, 
initialize it and read some incoming signal in just one line of code.

Interfacing with PsychoPy
-------------------------
One nice feature provided by Systole is that it can run the recording of PPG signal
together with other Python scripts like Psychopy, which can be used to build 
psychological experiments. There are two ways for interfacing with other scripts, it
can be done either in a serial or in a (pseudo-) parallel way.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-78

.. code-block:: default


    # - The ``read()`` method will record for a predefined amount of time
    # (specified by the ``duration`` parameter, in seconds). This 'serial mode'
    # is the easiest and most robust method, but it does not allow the execution
    # of other instructions in the meantime.

    # Code 1 {}
    oxi.read(duration=10)
    # Code 2 {}

    # - The ``readInWaiting()`` method will only read the bytes temporally stored
    # in the USB buffer. For the Nonin device, this represents up to 10 seconds of
    # recording (this procedure should be executed at least one time every 10
    # seconds for a continuous recording). When inserted into a while loop, it can
    # record PPG signal almost in parallel with other commands.

    import time
    tstart = time.time()
    while time.time() - tstart < 10:
        oxi.readInWaiting()
        # Insert code here {...}








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-87

Online detection
----------------
The recording instance is also detecting heartbeats automatically in the background, 
and this information can be accessed in real-time to deliver stimuli time-locked to 
specific cardiac phases. Note that the delay between the actual heartbeat and the 
execution of computer code (here the `print` command in the example below) can be 
important. Also, it is important to note that the systolic peak detected in the PPG
signal is delayed relative to the R peaks observed in the ECG signal.

    while time.time() - tstart < 10:
        while oxi.serial.inWaiting() >= 5:
            paquet = list(oxi.serial.read(5))
