Heartbeat Evoked Arpeggios (cardiac-contingent stimuli)
=======================================================

This tutorial illustrates how to use the ``Oximeter`` class to trigger stimuli
at different phases of the cardiac cycle. The PPG signal is recorded for 30 seconds
and peaks are detected online. Four notes ('C', 'E', 'G', 'Bfl') are played in synch
with peak detection with various delays: no delay,  1/4, 2/4 or 3/4 of the previous
cardiac cycle length. While R-R intervals are prone to large changes over longer
timescales, such changes are physiologically limited from one heartbeat to the next,
limiting variance in the onset synchrony between the tones and the cardiac cycle.
On this basis, each presentation time is calibrated based on the previous RR-interval.
This procedure can easily be adapted to create a standard interoception task, e.g. by
either presenting tones at no delay (systole, s+) or a fixed offset (diastole, s-).

Recording

For the purpose of demonstration, here we simulate data acquisition through
the pulse oximeter using pre-recorded signal.

oximeter is plugged in.

Play the different tones at different intervals following the detection of the
systolic peaks, using the length of the previous RR interval as reference. To kee the
execution of the example simple we do no pla atual sounds (e.g. using Psychopy) but
this step can easily be added by adding new lines for each time window.

Events
--------
We now have triggers for the presentation of different notes relative to the systolic 
peaks detected in the PPG signal in real-time. We can visualize the distribution
of these events using the `plot_events` function that will take the cleaned triggers
channels as input. We can see in the plot below that the events are nicely aligned
with the PPG signal.

Cardiac cycle
-------------
Another way to have a look at this event distribution is to look at when they occur
relative to the cardiac cycle. Considering that one full cycle (beat to beat) can be
represented as the full revolution around a trigonometric circle, it is possible to
show the occurrence of an event relative to this cardiac phase.
